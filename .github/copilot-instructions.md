# Neuro Memory Trainer - Copilot Instructions

This is a Next.js 14 memory training application using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand for state management.

## Project Setup Status

- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements (Next.js App Router, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind, Zustand, memory training focus)
- [x] Scaffold the Project (Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind skeleton with core folders)
- [x] Customize the Project (Cognitive hooks, Zustand store, placeholder UI components)
- [x] Install Required Extensions (None additional required for this setup)
- [x] Compile the Project (Dependencies installed, ESLint and build configured, all tests passing)
- [x] Create and Run Task (VS Code tasks configured for dev, build, and lint)
- [x] Launch the Project (Development server tested and working)
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete (README.md updated, copilot-instructions.md cleaned)

## Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript strict mode conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Maintain consistent code formatting with Prettier
- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Use Zustand for global state management
- Follow the existing component structure in `src/components/`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server on http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Run production build
- `npm run lint` - Check code with ESLint
- `npm run format` - Check formatting with Prettier
- `npm run format:fix` - Fix formatting issues
